# Samples of the PressMint-FI corpus

## Data source

The sources of the PressMint-FI corpus will be the copyright-free
years of the klk-fi-v2 (Finnish, already available) and klk-sv-v2
(Swedish, being finished for publication) corpora of newspapers and
periodicals published in Finland, OCR'd by the National Library,
further processed and made available (so far in a version of the
CWB-VRT format) by the Language Bank of Finland (Kielipankki).

The two samples files consist of one random page for each decade from
1820 to 1919, which makes a total of 10 Finnish and 10 Swedish pages.
(Previous PUB corpora end in 1874 and 1879, respectively. It __may__
be possible to publish newer material now, under discussion.)

### Details of the source:

* __Source__:

    Finnish and Swedish newspaper and periodical corpora klk-fi-v2
    (already published) and klk-sv-v2 (being published). (Should
    really put proper links here. TODO)

* __Availability__:

    klk-fi-v2 is already available from Kielipankki both in Korp and
    for download (older parts as CLARIN PUB, newer parts as ACA),
    klk-sv-v2 to be made available this spring (2026).

* __Content__:

    Newspapers and periodicals published in Finland since 1771, OCR
    carried out by the National Library, further processing of the
    METS/Alto pages in the Language Bank (Kielipankki)

* __Size__: lots, depending on what time period can be provided
    (numbers have been made, TODO add numbers here)

* __Structure__: pages, segmented in paragraphs, sentences, tokens

* __Correction__: 

* __Linguistic annotation__:

    The Finnish data is annotated with a grammatical dependency model
    that predates Universal Dependencies (corresponding to an old
    Turku Dependency Treebank), the Swedish data with Sparv from the
    Swedish Language Bank (Språkbanken), so a very different looking
    dependency syntax. Reprocessing might be possible, likely with
    Trankit and its relatively current UD models.

    Sentences are annotated with an identified language, paragraphs
    and texts with the counts of each identified language in them.

* __Metadata__:

    The texts (pages) in the corpus have the following metadata:

    - Document ID (both a binding id and a generated text id)
    - Publication date
    - Publication title
    - Page number
    - Publication type (newspaper, periodical)
    - Image URL (skeletal in the metadata)
    - Language of the publication
    - Identified languages (numbers of sentences)
    
* __Format__:

    Source is in a version of CWB-VRT, like TSV segmented with
    XML-like tags, with names provided for positional attributes in a
    special comment. Kielipankki has developed their own tools and
    skills for this.

* __Facsimile__:

    Links to National Library web pages can be generated from the
    metadata.

## Conversion plan

    For the PressMint-FI corpus we plan to:

    - write a script, presumably
    - may need to learn some TEI
    - possibly use a previously written conversion tool, should that
      turn out to be at all compatible with PressMint (Martin should
      know where the tool is)
    - possibly filter out "sentences" that were not identified as any
      known language (coded as xxx anyway, should be und, oh well)
